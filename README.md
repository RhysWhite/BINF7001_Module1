# Rhys' Toolkit
This repository is to provide basic Linux/unix commands and how to use command line tools. Some unix tutorial notes can be found in the [Software Carpentry
resources](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/aio/index.html).

Please note, you should insert the relivant information whenever you see `<>`. For example, when you see `$ echo "My name is <name>"` you should use `$ echo "My name is Rhys"`
