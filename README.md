# BINF7001_Module1
This repository is to compliment the practical sessions which will take you through basic Linux/unix commands and how to use command line tools. If you find this session a struggle please spend the next week going through the unix tutorial notes in the [Software Carpentry
resources](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/aio/index.html) and review your notes from BINF6000 on commandline computing.

Please note, you should insert the relivant information whenever you see `<>`. For example, when you see `$ echo "My name is <name>"` you should use `$ echo "My name is Rhys"`
